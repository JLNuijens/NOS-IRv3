18344	Hurricane Sandy was the first hurricane to hit Jamaica in 24 years. The winds caused widespread damage and loss of power to 70% of the population. This damage to Jamaica was estimated to be worth $55.23 million. One man also lost his life during the storm when a rock slide was triggered near his rural home.
18346	On October 24, Sandy became a hurricane, made landfall near Kingston, Jamaica, re-emerged a few hours later into the Caribbean Sea and strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane. On October 25, Sandy hit Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane, then weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. Early on October 26, Sandy moved through the Bahamas. On October 27, Sandy briefly weakened to a tropical storm and then restrengthened to a Category 1 hurricane.

52523	Convergent boundary. (Redirected from Convergent fault) In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary, is a region of active deformation where two or more tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere near the end of their life cycle. This is in contrast to a constructive plate boundary (also known as a mid-ocean ridge or spreading center). As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near destructive boundaries, where subduction zones or an area of continental collision (depending on the nature of the plates involved) occurs.
57443	Monotonic Function. Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.
57444	To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.
57447	Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.
57448	I've never heard of monotonic being used for two (input) variables, but I suppose it would mean that, for each fixed value of y, u is a monotonic function of x, and for each fixed value of x, u is a monotonic function of y (and I expect they'd need to be either both monotonic increasing or both monotonic decreasing).
57449	The textbook says it's a way of transforming a set of numbers into another set that preserves the order. But I don't understand what that means. Here are a few examples. The question was: do these functions represent a monotonic transformation. u = 2v - 13 (yes) u = -1/v2 (no) u = ln(v) (yes) u = v2 (no)

If there exists a number m such that for every n we say the sequence is bounded below.
58384	Adult cat fleas die in temperatures colder than 46.4°F (8°C), and hotter than 95°F (35°C). However, the low-end extreme for immature fleas is 55.4°F (13°C). During winter, adults can survive in cold temperatures while living on a warm-bodied host.
58385	Adult Fleas. Temperatures below freezing are lethal to adult fleas . They’ll die within five days at 30.2°F (-1°C) Fig 2. At 24 hours, there’s mortality in 20% of emerged adults and 72% of pre-emerged adults. Fleas can live up to ten days at 37.4°F (3°C).
58386	Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live for up to a year and a half.
58387	Flea larvae develop more quickly at higher temperatures, preferring areas that are 70° to 90°F. At cool temperatures, fully formed fleas can remain in their cocoons for up to 12 months. Warm temperatures and mechanical pressure caused by walking on or vacuuming carpet stimulate emergence from the cocoon.

68647	Extended Conjecture: (Trapezoid Midsegment Conjecture): The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.
68648	A trapezoid midsegment connects the midpoints of the two congruent sides of the trapezoid, and is parallel to the pair of parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.
68649	The midsegment of a trapezoid is referred to as the median or the midline. The length of the midsegment is calculated by finding the average length of each of the parallel sides. The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.
68653	The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.

95512	Large aquariums are a definite requirement for their long-term care and survival, as goldfish can grow quite large, depending on the breed. The common goldfish, so popular on fairgrounds, are among the largest, and they are capable of reaching over 18 inches and 10 pounds. Even the smallest breeds can reach between 4 and 7 inches, making them more suitable for a 20-gallon or larger aquarium than a bowl.

I've introduced small goldfish into my tanks with my big ones several times.  I just measured one of my comet goldfish, 14 inches 1  long. goldfish get really  big.
95514	Fancy goldfish typically grow to 8 inches, while single tail goldfish grow to 10 and sometimes up to 12 inches in length. It's rare for domestic goldfish to achieve the monstrous sizes recorded in the Netherlands and Michigan; these fish were exceptions to the norm.
95515	How big your goldfish will grow is determined by the animal's genetics, not by the size of his environment. If your goldfish doesn't have enough space to grow to his full size, he will likely die before you notice that the environment is not large enough.
95517	A more common size would be about 12 inches for a common and about 8 to 10 inches for a fancy. They will grow faster, but not necessarily ultimately larger, in large ponds than in aquaria. People who say they get to be three feet long probably have goldfish confused with koi or other carp.
95518	The cleanliness of your pet's environment, the kinds of food, and your feeding protocols are all factors. Genetics are the predetermined factor in how big your fish will grow. Goldfish sold as tank suitable will grow to about 10 inches while those sold as pond suitable will reach a maximum of about 18 inches.
95519	This Site Might Help You. RE: How big do goldfish get? OK so I know a lot of people say a fancy one will grow to 12&#39;&#39; but I think that&#39;s kind of ridiculous. A lot of these &quot;huge goldfish&quot; myths seem to only take place on the internet.
95521	Small tanks provide poorer water quality than large ones, and will stunt growth in goldfish, often preventing them from reaching their average size of between 8 and 12 inches. But give a goldfish good quality water and lots of space and you’ll give him every chance of growing to a good size.

96851	Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.
96852	Flea Pupa. The flea larvae spin cocoons around themselves in which they move to the last phase of the flea life cycle and become adult fleas. The larvae can remain in the cocoon anywhere from one week to one year. Temperature is one factor that determines how long it will take for the adult flea to emerge from the cocoon.
96853	The beginning of the life cycle occurs when an adult female flea lays eggs following a blood meal from the host (e.g., your pet). Blood is necessary for the adult flea to reproduce. These eggs are small, white objects (slightly smaller than a grain of sand) that are laid in the pet’s fur in bunches of about 20.
96854	2) The fleas life cycle discussed - the flea life cycle diagram explained in full. 2a) Fleas life cycle 1 - The adult flea lays her eggs on the host animal. 2b) Fleas life cycle 2 - The egg falls off the animal's skin and into the local environment of the host animal. 2c) Fleas life cycle 3 - The flea egg hatches, releasing a first stage (stage 1) flea larva.
96855	There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85°F and 70 percent humidity.
96856	The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home. This cocoon stage is the last developmental stage before the adult flea emerges. The cocoon protects the pupae for several days or weeks before the adult flea emerges.
96857	The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.
96858	The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.
96859	After about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva. This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.

In other words a piece of the gene may be an intron in one case and an exon in another case.Another possible explanation is that each exon codes for a module of a protein.ne hypothesis is that alternative splicing may allow a single gene to code for more than one version of a protein. In other words a piece of the gene may be an intron in one case and an exon in another case. Another possible explanation is that each exon codes for a module of a protein.
327909	Interspersed within the exons are introns, regions of non-coding DNA. Introns must be removed from the initial transcript of mRNA before the final mature transcript is sent to the ribosome for translation into protein. This removal is done in a coimplex protein structure called the spliceosome.The spliceosome splices out the non-coding introns from the primary mRNA transcript, and stiches the exons back together into the mature mRNA transcript.he spliceosome is a complex of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and small nuclear protein (snRNP) molecules, snRNAs and snRNPs.
327913	Splicing. Eukaryotic genes are often interrupted by sequences that do not appear in the final RNA. The intervening sequences that are removed are called introns. The process by which introns are removed is referred to as splicing.The sequences remaining after the splicing are called exons. All of the different major types of RNA in a eukaryotic cell can have introns.plicing. Eukaryotic genes are often interrupted by sequences that do not appear in the final RNA.

528373	Here are 10 curious facts about those pesky fleas. 1. Fleas have four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, biting adult. 2. Fleas feed on the blood of their host -- humans, birds, reptiles, and wild and domestic animals.
528375	The Pet Shed Petcyclopedia explains that a flea can live for a little over 130 days when it has access to a host. When a flea loses its host, it must find a new one as quickly as possible. According to 1-800-PetMeds, a little over half of newborn fleas may be able to survive for two months without a host if their environment is humid enough.
528376	Cat fleas can survive solely on a diet of human blood. They’re capable of living for 139 to 185 days if fed on human arms for 15 minutes each day. 10 minute feeding intervals can keep females alive for up to 30 days, and males for 17 days. In a recent study, fleas had continuous access to human blood for 12 days in an artificial setting. A significant number of fleas survived, especially when dog hair was added to their cages.
528377	In a humid environment, over 60% of newly hatched fleas can live without a host for 2 months. In a cool, dry environment, only 10% will live without an immediate host. Humidity is the key to flea survival.
528378	Quick Answer. The amount of time fleas can survive without feeding varies from several days to two months depending on the humidity of the environment. Fleas thrive in humid environments.
528379	Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, as long as they do not emerge from their cacoons. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 70°F to 85°F and optimum humidity is 70 percent. Breaking the cycle with an Insect Growth Regulator , not just killing the few adults is the secret to flea control.
528380	In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.
528381	Adult fleas cannot survive or lay eggs without a blood meal, but may hibernate from two months to one year without feeding. There is often a desperate need for flea control after a family has returned from a long vacation. The house has been empty with no cat or dog around for fleas to feed on.

549465	RSA is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and it is different from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of the factorization of the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem. The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly desc
552765	In order to develop, flea eggs need a warm, moist environment: a temperature of about 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) and 70 to 85 percent humidity. In these conditions, the eggs hatch in about 12 days. This 12-day window is one of the reasons why it can be hard to get rid of fleas. Some insecticides kill adult fleas but not eggs, which means a whole new set of fleas can emerge after the adults have died.
563625	In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide.n example of a continental-oceanic subduction zone is the area along the western coast of South America where the oceanic Nazca Plate is being subducted beneath the continental South American Plate.

611271	This signal is then propagated along the axon (and not, say, back to its dendrites) until it reaches its axon terminals. An action potential travels along the axon quickly, moving at rates up to 150 meters (or roughly 500 feet) per second. Conduction ends at the axon terminals. Axon terminals are where neurotransmission begins. Hence, it is at axon terminals where the neuron sends its OUTPUT to other neurons.
613337	The outcome of social exclusion is that affected individuals or communities are prevented from participating fully in the economic, social, and political life of the society in which they live.
615407	First of all, let’s establish what each one stands for. A BSN is a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, while an ADN is an Associates Degree in Nursing. Both degrees lead to getting your RN but there are some differences between the two.The main difference is the length of time and the amount of credits required to complete the program.enerally speaking, the starting rate is the same for an ADN or a BSN prepared nurse, but because many advanced positions require a BSN, the BSN prepared nurse does have the potential to earn more money. In 2006 the state of California conducted a survey of registered nurses.
618555	Activity at an axon terminal: Neuron A is transmitting a signal at the axon terminal to neuron B (receiving).
618556	Axon terminals (also called synaptic boutons) are distal terminations of the branches of an axon. An axon nerve fiber is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses (called action potentials) away from the neuron's cell body, or soma, in order to transmit those impulses to other neurons.
618559	A neuron contains four main parts: the cell body, dendrites, the axon and the axon terminal. The axon is a long projection from the cell body of the neuron that transmits signals from one nerve cell to another. Bundles of axons are known as nerves. The longest axon in the human body is the sciatic nerve.
621539	Woodrow Wilson, a leader of the Progressive Movement, was the 28th President of the United States (1913-1921). After a policy of neutrality at the outbreak of World War I, Wilson led America into war in order to make the world safe for democracy..Like Roosevelt before him, Woodrow Wilson regarded himself as the personal representative of the people.y virtue of this legislation and the slogan he kept us out of war, Wilson narrowly won re-election. But after the election Wilson concluded that America could not remain neutral in the World War. On April 2,1917, he asked Congress for a declaration of war on Germany.
621544	Woodrow Wilson’s second term in office was dominated by World War I. Although the president had advocated for peace during the initial years of the war, in early 1917 German submarines launched unrestricted submarine attacks against U.S. merchant ships.+E Networks. Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924), the 28th U.S. president, served in office from 1913 to 1921 and led America through World War I (1914-1918).

684616	How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months.
684618	Full Answer. Fleas survive an average of eight days on a short-haired dog, and they typically last longer on a host with longer hair. Fleas need a food source to survive and reproduce to continue their life cycle, and a healthy flea can lay around 27 eggs each day.
684621	How long a dog flea survives depends on several factors. The average flea survives a few days to two weeks without a food supply, and they can live much longer with a host.
684622	They pupate and hatch as adult fleas, which jump onto a passing animal to use as a host. Females consume about 15 times their body weight in blood daily and begin laying eggs within two days of their first blood meal. Fleas do not live on human skin but will occasionally feed from humans. This can occur when people handle flea-infested animals or when fleas living in soft furnishings or pet beds need a meal and there is no cat or dog nearby.
684828	A: The United States fought Germany, Austria-Hungary and other members of the Central powers in World War I. America's primary enemy was Germany due to several of its actions designed to shift the war to its advantage.

687064	Drug therapy is not a cure, but it can make living with the condition easier. There are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex). These are all taken in pill form. Severe cases may be treated with the intravenous (IV) drug acyclovir.
689769	Sure, water might get your windshield clean in warm weather, but once the temperature drops, it’ll freeze up inside your tank and lines, potentially causing damage to your washer system and blinding you out on the highway. Another, more insidious side effect of using water in your windshield fluid reservoir has to do with bacteria. Over the course of a hot summer, even the purest water can breed microbes, such as the legionella bacteria that cause Legionnaire’s disease, and make you sick when you activate your washers and spray the toxic mixture into the air.
690634	1 Convergent Boundaries-A convergent boundary is where two tectonic plates push together. 2  Sometimes one plate will move under the other. 3  This is called subduction. 4  Although the movement is slow, convergent boundaries can be areas of geological activity such as the forming of mountains and volcanoes.he part of the land that is moving is the Earth's surface called the lithosphere. The lithosphere is made up of the Earth's crust and a part of the upper mantle. The lithosphere moves in big chunks of land called tectonic plates. Some of these plates are huge and cover entire continents.

742044	Generally, they do, but look closer. Feel the needles. Spruces have stiff, prickly needles, while Douglas-firs and true firs have soft, flexible needles. Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg; in fact, this peg is one of the best ways to identify a spruce. Spruce cones hang down from the branches like those of Douglas-fir while true fir cones stand up, but spruce cones do not have Douglas-fir's pitchfork bracts. The scales of most spruce cones are papery thin--yet another difference. And spruce bark is scaly--Douglas-fir and the true firs have smooth or ridged bark. There are approximately 40 different species of spruce in the world, but only 3 are native to the Pacific Northwest--and only 2 of those are common. Location is probably the best clue to their identity. : grows only along the Pacific coast, from northern California through southeastern Alaska, and only near sea level.

749539	Exome sequencing workflow: part 1. Exome sequencing is a technique for sequencing all the protein-coding genes in a genome (known as the exome).It consists of first selecting only the subset of DNA that encodes proteins (known as exons), and then sequencing that DNA using any high throughput DNA sequencing technology.xome sequencing is especially effective in the study of rare Mendelian diseases, because it is the most efficient way to identify the genetic variants in all of an individual's genes.
749540	Frequently Asked Questions What is Exome Sequencing? Also known as whole exome sequencing, targeted exome capture or next gen sequencing, exome sequencing looks at the protein coding regions of the human genome known as exons.There are about 180,000 exons in the human genome and it is estimated that 85% of the disease-causing mutations can be found in these regions.hat is the difference between whole genome AND whole exome sequencing? While whole exome sequencing looks at the exon regions of the genome, whole exome sequencing looks at both the exons and introns covering the entire genome.
749542	The human genome consists of 3 billion nucleotides or “letters” of DNA. But only a small percentage — 1.5 percent — of those letters are actually translated into proteins, the functional players in the body.The “exome” consists of all the genome’s exons, which are the coding portions of genes.The term exon was derived from “EXpressed regiON,” since these are the regions that get translated, or expressed as proteins, as opposed to the intron, or “INTRagenic regiON” which is not represented in the final protein.ut only a small percentage — 1.5 percent — of those letters are actually translated into proteins, the functional players in the body. The “exome” consists of all the genome’s exons, which are the coding portions of genes.

1610706	Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.
1610707	30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.
1610709	The pupa is the life cycle stage of the flea that is the most vitalto a flea population's persistence in a host environment. The reason why this stage of the flea life cycleis so important to the flea population as a whole is because of the fact that flea cocoons generally only hatch in the presence of a host animal.
1610710	Fleas go through four life cycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.
1610711	The Flea Life Cycle. Fleas undergo complete metamorphosis with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Environmental variables influence the length of each developmental stage. Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70° and 90° Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more.
1610714	The flea life cycle is very important to know if a flea infestationis to be controlled adequately and permanently (after all, much of the flea life cycle occurs in the animal's environment, not on the animal itself, and so environmental flea control is very important).
1611215	Fleas are parasites -- or life forms that feed on hosts -- often harming the host in some way. Fleas use their hosts' blood as food. They generally prefer the blood of four-legged animals to human blood, so before you went on vacation, the fleas fed on your pets, not on you. Although newly emerged fleas need to find food within a few days, adults can go for a couple of months without a meal.
1611221	Of all four stages of the flea (egg, larva, pupa, adult) the eggs and larvae make up about 80% of the total flea population in an infested home. Approximately 2% of the population is made up of adults. The best pest management programs center on the prevention of immature fleas rather than the adults. There are two basic ways to address the problem: try to prevent any stage of the pest from entering the home and keep immature stages from maturing into adults.

2223171	When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider. First, it is very important to be familiar with and understand the life cycle of the flea when you are trying to eradicate their presence completely. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85°F and 70 percent humidity.

2258591	Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.
2258592	Tracheid. a dead lignified plant cell that functions in water conduction. Tracheids are found in the xylem of all higher plants except certain angiosperms, such as cereals and sedges, in which the water-conducting function is performed by vessels, or tracheae.Tracheids are usually polygonal in cross section; their walls have annular, spiral, or scalene thickenings or rimmed pores.racheids are found in the xylem of all higher plants except certain angiosperms, such as cereals and sedges, in which the water-conducting function is performed by vessels, or tracheae.

2259179	1 Sadly, many goldfish never live long enough to even grow the 8 inches, 10 inches, or even 20 inches long their body was destined to be.  Water changes can be very stressful in a small goldfish tank. Goldfish prefer water that maintains a constant temperature. A small aquarium just can’t hold enough water mass.
2259180	Get a large enough tank. The minimum tank size for one goldfish is 10-15 US gallons (56.7 liters)(Remember, they grow to about 10-12 inches (25.5-30.5 centimeters), and sometimes over!) and you will need to add 10 U.S. gallons (37.8 liters) onto that for each additional goldfish. Do your research about all different kinds of goldfish.
2259182	Common goldfish, comet goldfish, and other single tail goldfish need ponds or huge tanks as they can grow up to a foot or more in length. Do not get single tails unless you have a 180 US gallon (681.4 liter) tank laying around or a pond into which you can transition them when they get too large. For decades goldfish were touted as being able to live in small bowls, and thus why they have a reputation of having short life spans.
2259183	A large tank gives your goldfish plenty of room to grow to their full potential. In a small 5-gallon aquarium, your goldfish will still grow. But growth will become stunted, and your goldfish won’t be able to develop properly. In such an environment, goldfish usually don’t last any more than a couple of years.

2533256	Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence. This mature mRNA is ready for translation.

The author discusses the science related to mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS.
2922148	Instead, it is usually an indication that the mechanical ventilation is not being optimized through the tube inserted through the mouth. A tracheostomy might afford the patient a better pattern of breathing and hence a better possibility of surviving ARDS.A tracheostomy might also make for an easier, somewhat more comfortable course of treatment, in patients who are prone to fighting the vent.nstead, it is usually an indication that the mechanical ventilation is not being optimized through the tube inserted through the mouth. A tracheostomy might afford the patient a better pattern of breathing and hence a better possibility of surviving ARDS.
2923493	If hard-boiled is how you like your eggs, then a 165°F sous-vide egg should do you well. This is the ideal temperature for an egg salad that has distinct chunks of tender, non-rubbery egg. Loose white: Opaque and firm, but still tender. Tight white: Opaque and firm, but still tender.nce cooked, you can chill the eggs in an ice bath and store them in water in the refrigerator for up to a few days. To serve them, just submerge them in warm (130 to 140°F water) for ten minutes or so and they're as good as fresh. I use these eggs as the foundation for all sorts of dishes.
2923494	There are few things lovelier than a perfectly poached egg. The way a thick, flavorful yolk, and tender egg white coat a dish in a naturally savory sauce is a beautiful thing.Creating a well-made poached egg—a fundamental technique that often eludes even the finest cooks—became infinitely easier, and perhaps even foolproof, with the rise of sous vide cooking.ut the beauty is this: With sous vide, you can play with different times and temperatures to produce nearly any desired outcome. Whether you like your eggs runny, firm, thick, or hard-boiled, sous vide gets the job done.
2923496	We cook a egg (extra large) at a high temperature (167 °F / 75 °C) for a short amount of time (13 minutes), rather than at equilibrium temp for longer, to create a firm egg white that's very similar to a traditionally poached egg.ut the beauty is this: With sous vide, you can play with different times and temperatures to produce nearly any desired outcome. Whether you like your eggs runny, firm, thick, or hard-boiled, sous vide gets the job done.
2923497	(2) Sous vide “hard boiled” eggs: For a hard boiled egg cooked sous vide style, I love 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius), cooked for 60 minutes.At this temperature, eggs are a bit softer and creamier than the traditional hard boiled egg, making them more moist, but still capable of being cut into slices.2) Sous vide “hard boiled” eggs: For a hard boiled egg cooked sous vide style, I love 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius), cooked for 60 minutes.
2923498	1. Adjust sous-vide cooker to 143°F. Alternatively, fill a large beer cooler with hot water and use a kettle of boiling water to adjust heat to 146°F. Add eggs to sous-vide cooker or to cooler (cover if using cooler) and cook for 45 minutes.Remove from cooler and allow to cool slightly. 2. Bring a medium pot of water to a bare simmer, then lower heat until bubbles cease entirely.Working on egg at a time, carefully crack the egg near the fat end and use your fingertips to peel off an area about 1 1/2 inches square. Invert egg over a small bowl. It should slip out of the shell easily.. Adjust sous-vide cooker to 143°F. Alternatively, fill a large beer cooler with hot water and use a kettle of boiling water to adjust heat to 146°F. Add eggs to sous-vide cooker or to cooler (cover if using cooler) and cook for 45 minutes.
2923501	TAKE 1. Method: Eggs cooked sous vide at 62.5 C for 60 minutes. Result: Delicious yolks the consistency of runny honey but unattractively semi-set, semi-opaque white with an alarming tendency to separate from the yolk and disappear under the spinach leaves.HE VERDICT. 1. Cooking an egg sous vide is not a substitute for soft-boiling or poaching. You will get delicious results (with a little perseverance!); you will get intriguing results – but you will not replicate the effects of conventional cooking. 2.

2928705	I read somewhere totally scientific that goldfish will grow to a size commensurate with the size of their environment. So what if I filled a swimming pool with fresh water and all the bells and whistles they need to survive: filters, feeders, temperature regulators, aerators and what not, would I end up with dog-sized goldfish?
2928706	Hardly anything breeds true.. People who groom goldfish for shows take such extreme measures as daily 100% water changes and feeding every hour during daylight hours to produce big fish fast. Some of them also say that show fish aren't good breeders and don't live as long as fish that grow at a normal rate.
2928707	Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure. There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing. Most fishes are in fact what are known as indeterminate growers.

2960564	Word Origin and History for visceral Expand. adj. 1570s, affecting inward feelings, from Middle French viscéral, from Medieval Latin visceralis internal, from Latin viscera, plural of viscus internal organ, of unknown origin. The bowels were regarded as the seat of emotion. The figurative sense vanished after 1640 and the literal sense is first recorded in 1794.
2960566	Best Answer: It has two meanings. It can mean relating to the internal organs of your body (the visceral organs), or it can mean relating to deep emotional feelings that are separate from intellect. Visceral means, roughly, in the guts. The viscera are your internal organs. The word is Latin. So, if you have a visceral feeling, it means a feeling on the inside, in your internal organs; and usually this is referring to the guts (intestines). For instance, you have a gut feeling, something you feel inside you.

3125150	The color may range from dark green to quite blue, but if the needle rolls between your fingers as smoothly as a square wheel, it's a spruce. If you try this with a fir needle, it won't roll at all because it's flat. Like spruce needles, fir needles don't grow in bundles, either. Like spruce trees, fir trees tend to be tall, dark and symmetrical. Like pine trees, some types of fir trees are used for Christmas trees.
3125152	A distinguishing trait of pine trees is that their leaves (the needles) are bundled together, usually in packs of two to five. The needles may be long or short or somewhere in between, but if you find needles in bundles, you have a pine tree. If you examine a needle from a tree and find out that it's not round and not flat but rather four-sided, you are looking at a spruce needle.
3125154	Like fir trees, spruces have single needles connected to the stems. However, spruce tree needles are sharp and square-shaped. On a real tree, spruce needles easily break apart if you bend them. As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.
3125155	Sometimes a spruce can be mistaken for a fir, but you can the difference by looking closely at the needles. If the needle is flat, then it is a fir because spruce needles have four sides. Fir tree cones are much softer than pine cones. Pines and firs both are often used for landscaping purposes and shade.
3128361	Eukaryotic mRNA Processing. Unlike prokaryotes which have one RNA polymerase that makes all classes of RNA molecules, eukaryotic cells have three types of RNA polymerase (called RNA pol I, RNA pol II, and RNA pol III), and each type of RNA is made by its own polymerase:he process by which introns are removed is referred to as splicing.

3338821	Flea larvae do not take a blood meal directly from a host, unlike adult fleas. The flea’s larval stage is completed within about 4-18 days. One of the last activities of flea larvae is to spin a silken cocoon and then enter the pupal stage.
3338822	They eat the feces of adult fleas (which is mostly dried blood) and other organic debris found in the carpet, bedding, and soil. Depending on the amount of food present and the environmental conditions, the larval stage lasts about 5 to 18 days (longer in some cases) then the larva spins a silken cocoon and pupates.
3338825	The cat flea’s life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat flea’s life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 ½ months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.
3338826	PUPA (plural = pupae): The pupa is the last stage before adult. The adult flea can emerge from the cocoon as early as 3 to 5 days, or it can stay in the cocoon for a year or more, waiting for the right time to emerge.
3338827	The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. ADULT: The adult flea is very flat side to side. There are hair-like bristles on the flea body and legs to aid in their navigation through pet hair.
3338828	Flea eggs hatch into larvae within one to 12 days. Larvae. Flea larvae are approximately 3 to 5.2 mm long and are semitransparent white in color. The larval stage lasts from four to 18 days, after which larvae spin silken cocoons and enter the pupal stage. The pupal stage may be complete within three days, or it can last as long as one year.
3342536	Getting Legionnaires' disease—a type of pneumonia carried by stagnant water. Avoid both by setting your water heater to just the right temperature. The DIY experts at Stack Exchange are here to help.
3344828	LEGIONELLA PNEUMOPHILA. Like C. pneumoniae, Legionella species are intracellular organisms. Legionella pneumophila is the most pathogenic species, and several serotypes have been identified. Serotype 1 has been associated with most reported human cases of pneumonia caused by L. pneumonphila.11.
3344830	A particular feature of Legionella is its dual host system allowing the intracellular growth in protozoa (amoebae), and during infection in human pulmonary alveolar macrophages. (8) Like macrophages, amoebae ingest L. pneumophila by phagocytosis, which can be mediated by amoebic-specific receptors.
3344832	Much of the research done on Legionella pneumophila is related to ecology and how it relates to the environment. Some studies compare L. pneumophila to other microorganisms. Other studies look at the cases of Legionellosis and investigate the causes of the outbreaks.
3344833	Invasion and intracellular replication of L. pneumophila within pulmonary cells in the alveoli are the hallmark of Legionnaires’ disease [30]. The alveolar wall is composed of macrophages and type I and type II epithelial cells.
3344834	Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms.

3344837	Legionella pneumophila, a Gram-negative bacillus ubiquitous in aquatic environments, is responsible for Legionnaires’ disease. It is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can replicate within eukaryotic host cells such as protozoa and macrophages. In humans, L. pneumophila reaches the lungs after inhalation of contaminated aerosol droplets [1] ; [2] (Fig. 1 ).
3348837	In most cases, a neurotransmitter is released from the axon terminal after an action potential has reached the synapse. The neurotransmitter then crosses the synaptic gap to reach the receptor site of the other cell or neuron.
3348838	The axon is a single process extending from the axon hillock,sometimes covered by a fatty layer called a myelin sheath thatconducts nerve impulses away from the cell body of t…he neuron. Distal tips of axons are telodendria, each of which terminates in a synaptic knob.

3372501	The life cycle depends on the humidity and temperature of your house: The eggs hatch in 1-6 days. They will be in the carpet, the furniture and are in highest numbers where she spends most of her time. The eggs hatch to become larvae. They molt and have 3 stages. The total time for this stage is 6-36 days. The pupae is a cocoon that the larvae goes into. The cocoon takes about 7-10 days to develop but then can be dormant for a long time until a host enters the situation (such as a cat). The adult flea is really only on the pet for about 2 weeks. The rest of the time is spent off the pet.

3389578	Exons and introns are related to genes. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.
3389579	Exons vs Introns. Exons and introns are related to genes. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.
3389580	Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence.
3389581	1. Exons are coding areas whereas introns are non-coding areas. 2. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule. 3.
3389582	Exons and introns are part of the mRNA. During transcription inside the nucleus, introns are removed from the mRNA because they are not coded to make a protein. Exons are then … joined together because that is the part required for translation.
3389584	In some genes, not all of the DNA sequence is used to make protein. Introns are noncoding sections of an RNA transcript, or the DNA encoding it, that are spliced out before the RNA molecule is translated into a protein. The sections of DNA (or RNA) that code for proteins are called exons.

3396076	There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).
3398083	Destruction (recycling) of crust takes place along convergent Divergent Margins boundaries where plates are moving toward each other, and sometimes one plate sinks (is subducted) beneath another. The location where the sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone. A transform boundary is where plates slide past each other with no creation or destruction of lithosphere. Plate Margin Examples There are three general types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. Each general type has multiple ‘species’: divergent boundaries can be spreading ocean ridges or continental rift zones; convergent boundaries can occur between two continental plates.

3577344	The flea life cycle has four stages: 1  Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2  Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3  Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea.  Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.
3577345	The pupal stage (cocoon) - The cocoon is the crux of flea infestation persistence in the house-hold. It generally hatches in 1-2 weeks, but can last up to a year.

Legionnaires' disease is an infection of the lungs and is a form of pneumonia. More than 43 species of Legionella have been identified and more than 20 linked with human diseases.
3681095	What Is Legionnaires' Disease. Legionnaires’ disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections. The disease typically presents as pneumonia and symptoms may include a high fever, chills, cough, muscle aches, headaches, and diarrhea.

Signs and symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle pains, and headaches. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. This often begins two to ten days after being exposed.
3681098	How It Spreads. After Legionella grows and multiplies in a building water system, that contaminated water then has to spread in droplets small enough for people to breathe in. People can get Legionnaires’ disease when they breathe in small droplets of water in the air that contain the bacteria.

3883077	In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.wo facts about these functions are: 1  if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.

4458506	A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.
4458509	The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.
4458510	The North American plate also serves to illustrate this difference. The west coast is the active margin, and is the location of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountains. The Eastern Seaboard is a passive margin, as is the Gulf Coast. These are the low-relief areas of our continent, and are the locations of such exciting places as New Jersey, the Barrier Islands, the swamps of Florida, and the Mississippi delta.

4493913	Exons vs Introns. Exons and introns are related to genes. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.. Exons can be termed as DNA bases which are translated into mRNA. Introns are also DNA bases that are found in between exons. 6. Introns are very much common in the genome of higher vertebrates such as human beings and mice but unlikely to be seen in the genome of certain varieties of eukaryotic micro-organisms.

4493915	Exons. Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron. In simple terms, it could be stated that exons really hit the ground in the expression of genes or in the protein synthesis.The polypeptide strand is formed based on the nucleotide sequence in exons. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. • When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. • Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.

Introns are also sometimes termed as intervening sequences. ‘Exon’ is a term that is derived from ‘expressed region.’ Walter Gilbert, an American biochemist, coined the term.. Exons can be termed as DNA bases which are translated into mRNA. Introns are also DNA bases that are found in between exons. 6. Introns are very much common in the genome of higher vertebrates such as human beings and mice but unlikely to be seen in the genome of certain varieties of eukaryotic micro-organisms.
4493919	Introns. Introns are sequences of nucleotides present in the genes between exons. These nucleotide sequences do not code for proteins, and that means introns are not immediately important for the process of protein synthesis. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. • When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. • Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.
4493920	Exons are the DNA sequences that code for proteins. Introns are involved however they dont carry the genetic information that exons carry, the variation provides for revolutio … nary flexibility allowing cells to shuffle exons between genes to make new ones.aking the world better, one answer at a time. The difference between exons and introns is that exons are codes of proteins, while introns are not involved with the coding for proteins.

4684891	Synaptic signals from other neurons are received by the soma and dendrites; signals to other neurons are transmitted by the axon. A typical synapse, then, is a contact between the axon of one neuron and a dendrite or soma of another.hese signals between neurons occur via synapses, specialized connections with other cells. Neurons can connect to each other to form neural networks. Neurons are the core components of the brain and spinal cord of the central nervous system (CNS), and of the ganglia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

4687213	Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil. After several moults, they grow to about 3 mm, cease to feed and burrow down into the soil to a depth of about 15 cm.

4727417	Introns and exons are parts of genes. exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. Exons are parts of DNA that are converted into mature messenger RNA . The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription. This mRNA then undergoes a further process called translation where the mRNA is used to synthesize proteins, via another type of molecule called transfer RNA.
4727418	Transcrition/translation - Exons and introns. In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence. This mature mRNA is ready for translation.
4727419	These arguments lead to the conclusion that the vast majority of cellular DNA isn't functional. Genes that are expressed usually have introns that interrupt the coding sequences. A typical eukaryotic gene, therefore, consists of a set of sequences that appear in mature mRNA (called exons) interrupted by introns. The regions between genes are likewise not expressed, but may help with chromatin assembly, contain promoters, and so forth. See Figure 1.

4842889	RSA (algorithm) RSA is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of them can be given to everyone. The other key must be kept private.
4842890	What is RSA? RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication; it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [RSA78]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.
4842891	Related Terms. A public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc. The acronym stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman, the inventors of the technique. The RSA algorithm is based on the fact that there is no efficient way to factor very large numbers. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, requires an extraordinary amount of computer processing power and time.
4842894	RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. Typically a key fob (such as an RSA SecurID security token) is used by employees in security-sensitive companies. The token generates a public key that changes every minute.
4842895	RSA Security is a United States-based organization that creates encryption, network and computer security products. Ron Rivest Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman founded RSA as an independent company in 1982. RSA derives from the initials of each of the founders names.

5460936	Exome sequencing workflow: part 1. Exome sequencing is a technique for sequencing all the protein-coding genes in a genome (known as the exome). It consists of first selecting only the subset of DNA that encodes proteins (known as exons), and then sequencing that DNA using any high throughput DNA sequencing technology.
5460939	The human genome consists of 3 billion nucleotides or “letters” of DNA. But only a small percentage — 1.5 percent — of those letters are actually translated into proteins, the functional players in the body. The “exome” consists of all the genome’s exons, which are the coding portions of genes. The term exon was derived from “EXpressed regiON,” since these are the regions that get translated, or expressed as proteins, as opposed to the intron, or “INTRagenic regiON” which is not represented in the final protein.
5460941	The sum total of the exons in a genome, which comprise about 1% of human DNA. The exome is regarded as the most functionally relevant DNA, as it encodes proteins and gene products.

5546284	On true pine trees and larches, needles are arranged and attached to the branches in bundles or clusters with two, three or five needles per bunch. You can eliminate other conifers including spruce and fir trees if the needles are bundled. Spruce and fir have their needles attached individually to the branches using different attachments variously called pegs, suction cups, and stalks and are never bundled.
5546286	One of the best and easiest ways to tell the difference between a true spruce and fir tree is to look at the tree's cones. When mature, the cones on a fir tree stand straight up (point towards the sky) while the mature cones on a spruce grow down towards the ground from the bottom side of the branch. The way that I remember which grows up and which grows down is that I remember the s in spruce means that the cones spray the ground.
5546287	· Though both firs and pines are conifers, there are differences between the two varieties of conifers that are easy to detect. · The one major difference between firs and pines pertains to needles in their cones. While needles are in groups of 2-6 in case of pines, needles are single in case of firs. · Cones of firs are bluish green, while those of pine are brown and black. · Fir trees are pointed as they grow upwards.
5546288	Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.

5688727	How to Kill Fleas in a Home. Two Parts: Treating Your Home for Fleas Treating Your Pet for Fleas. Fleas are small, agile insects that live by feeding on the blood of other animals, usually your furry and harmless cat or dog. Fleas can be a real problem when they invade a household and its inhabitants.he easiest way to kill fleas is when they are at their most vulnerable—in the egg and larval stages of their development. An adult flea will live only about a week without blood from its host, while a flea larva can live several months, so it's important to attack the larvae first.
5688730	However, they are commonest in areas where animals sleep. Female fleas lay eggs in these areas. The eggs take about two weeks to hatch, depending on the temperature.

The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart.

The presence of introns is thought to assist gene regulation by way of complex methods like alternative splicing. After splicing, a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail are added, and this 'final draft' is called mature mRNA. Splicing, capping, and tailing comprise RNA processing in the nucleus. Once the mature mRNA moves into the cytoplasm, it begins translation and undergoes other forms of gene regulation.

5935473	It is difficult to distinguish Legionnaires' disease from other types of pneumonia by symptoms or radiologic findings alone; other tests are required for definitive diagnosis. Persons with Pontiac fever experience fever and muscle aches without pneumonia. They generally recover in two to five days without treatment.
5935474	Legionellosis is an infection that is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. The disease has two distinct forms: 1  Legionnaires' disease is the more severe form of the infection, which may involve pneumonia. 2  Pontiac fever is a milder illness that develops from hours to two days after initial infection and resolves spontaneously.
5935476	Legionnaires' disease, also known as legionellosis or Legion fever, is a form of atypical pneumonia caused by any type of Legionella bacteria. Over 90% of cases of Legionnaires' disease are caused by Legionella pneumophila. Other causative species include L. longbeachae, L. feeleii, L. micdadei, and L. anisa.

5956099	(Answer #1). The US entered World War I largely because of the German practice of submarine warfare. The entry of the US broke the stalemate that had existed for most of the war and led to the Allied victory.The US did not like the fact that Germany was using submarines to sink ships headed for England.he effects of the US entry are likely even harder to pin down as the Allies already had quite an advantage over the beleaguered German and Austrian forces and they were likely to sue for peace before much longer though there is some support for the idea that the American entry into the war helped to shorten it.
5956102	The House concurred two days later. The United States later declared war on Austria-Hungary on December 7, 1917. Germany's resumption of submarine attacks on passenger and merchant ships in 1917 was the primary motivation behind Wilson's decision to lead the United States into World War I.ilson cited Germany's violation of its pledge to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and its attempts to entice Mexico into an alliance against the United States, as his reasons for declaring war.

6105566	Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70° and 90° Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more. Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating.
6105567	Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.
6105568	Once mated, the female flea may deposit up to 50 eggs per day on your dog or cat. An adult flea typically lives for several months, so just a single flea can cause a significant infestation in a short amount of time. As your pet walks around your home, many of the flea eggs fall off. Cat flea eggs are tiny, measuring a mere 1/32 inch, so they can go unnoticed in your pet's bedding, in carpets, or on upholstered furniture. Within 2 to 5 days, wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. Lacking eyes and legs, you might think that flea larvae would have a tough time surviving in your carpet.
6105569	Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Its total life span can be as long one and one-half years in ideal conditions. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates. Average 30–90 days.
6105571	Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained.
6105572	Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.
6106022	Convergent boundary. In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide.n a subduction zone, the subducting plate, which is normally a plate with oceanic crust, moves beneath the other plate, which can be made of either oceanic or continental crust. During collisions between two continental plates, large mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas are formed.
6108721	The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.
6109460	Genes and RNA Splicing. In the SMN gene the protein coding information (exons) are interrupted by non-coding regions (introns). The introns need to be edited out of the RNA to produce the final set of instructions for the SMN protein. This process is called RNA splicing.. An animation shows how the DNA genetic code is made into protein.
6109461	1 Exons are expressing sequences within a pre-mRNA molecule that are spliced together once introns are removed to form mature mRNA molecules that are translated into proteins.  Alternative splicing allows for the production of various protein isoforms from one single gene coding.

Older, more established plants, usually at least 3 years in the ground, will grow faster than newly planted ones. Placement and care will influence how fast and tall a bamboo will grow.n general, bamboo will get as big as it can depending on how much space it has to grow, kind of like a goldfish in a goldfish bowl. If you want the bamboo to reach its full height, you need to be prepared to donate the space, an area at least 30 feet in circumference.

6413944	Female fleas will usually start laying their eggs in just a single day after coming into contact with your pet. Once the eggs have hatched into larvae, they feed on the dried remains of the adult fleas (blood and feces) and in some circumstances, also tapeworm eggs that was transferred from another pet or animal.
6413950	Since a female flea can lay about 40 eggs per day, a few case studies have shown that for each flea you find, there are an estimated 120 eggs (or a further stage of the flea development cycle) around your home (see photo of flea eggs above) or garden.
6413951	Since fleas can live up to a year and a half (See: How Long do Fleas Live) and lay up to 50 eggs a day all the while, it doesn't take much imagination to see how big the problem can get in a short period of time. CC Image courtesy of Denni Schnapp on Flickr.

6484575	Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor — such as high blood pressure or a heart condition — that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.
6484576	Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.

Long well developed divergent plate boundary, sea floor is elevated forming a broad line swell called the ocean ridge. knowledge of the ridge comes from soundings of the ocean floor and floor samples from deep sea drilling, visual inspections from deep submersibles.
6534824	Some convergent margins have zones of active seafloor spreading behind the island arc, known as back-arc basins. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range.This type of convergent boundary is similar to the Andes or the Cascade Range in North America.s a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved.

6541864	The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.n most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.

7125978	Contour plowing and terracing are both types of farming techniques. Contour plowing follows the natural shape of the land form without changing it whereas terracing changes the shape of the slope to develop flat areas for crop growth. Contour plowing and terracing are both types of farming techniques.
7125980	A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.
7125981	One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.
7125982	· just now. 1  The distinction between plowing and furrowing must be that furrowing by some convention excludes furrowing on the contour. But in areas with drifting dry soil, furrowing across the direction of the wind can bring that wind erosion under control long enough for a crop to emerge and keep the soil there.
7125983	Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007. Contour plowing (or contour ploughing) or contour farming is the farming practice of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.
7125985	Contour plowing and terracing are both types of farming techniques.Contour plowing follows the natural shape of the land form withoutchanging it whereas terracing changes the shape of the slope todevelop flat areas for crop growth.
7125987	Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the “natural shape” of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.

7371077	Goldfish are very large compared to many tropical fish species. Most fancy goldfish varieties grow up to 6 or 7 inches long (15 or 18 centimeters), while common and comet goldfish can grow to a foot long (30 centimeters) and even more. Though there are exceptions, tropical fish tend to stay small.
7371078	Goldfish bowls really shouldn't exist, to be honest. Goldfish can grow very large and some have lived up to 30 years! The recommendation is that you give a goldfish 10 gallons for every inch it is. So if your goldfish is 2 inches long, ideally it would have 20 gallons. While that seems a little excessive for most people, a ten gallon tank with a filter would be a great place to start. As other people have mentioned, goldfish are considered dirty fish.
7371079	In such an environment, goldfish usually don’t last any more than a couple of years. Sadly, many goldfish never live long enough to even grow the 8 inches, 10 inches, or even 20 inches long their body was destined to be. Water changes can be very stressful in a small goldfish tank. Goldfish prefer water that maintains a constant temperature.

7377270	One of the easiest ways to tell the difference between a spruce tree and a pine tree is by looking closely at their needles. While spruce needles tend to be shorter than those of pines -- roughly 1-inch long -- it's their notable stiffness that really gives them away.
7377271	Pine scales are noticeably thick, rigid and tough. Spruce bark typically feels rough when you run your hand across it, with a thin and scaly look that grows more furrowed as the tree ages. Pine bark in general is smooth when the tree is young but with age often develops a reddish-brown color and starts to flake.
7377272	The way that I remember which grows up and which grows down is that I remember the s in spruce means that the cones spray the ground. One of the best and easiest ways to tell the difference between a true spruce and fir tree is to look at the tree's cones. When mature, the cones on a fir tree stand straight up (point towards the sky) while the mature cones on a spruce grow down towards the ground from the bottom side of the branch.

When mature, the cones on a fir tree stand straight up (point towards the sky) while the mature cones on a spruce grow down towards the ground from the bottom side of the branch.
7377275	Differences Between Spruce & Fir Trees. Spruce and fir trees are biologically close cousins that belong to the family of evergreens known as conifers, or cone-bearing trees. Both species inhabit northern or high-altitude regions where the weather is typically cold during winter. At one time both species were referred to as fir trees.
7377277	The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.
7377278	Firs are often distinguished from their spruce cousins through the characteristics of their needles. Those of spruce trees are rather firm and rectangular when cut in cross section, while fir-tree needles are softer, flatter, and two-sided. The cones of fir trees are erect and have scales that fall off in autumn.
7384329	The determinants of health. Introduction. Many factors combine together to affect the health of individuals and communities. Whether people are healthy or not, is determined by their circumstances and environment.
7384332	The determinants of health include: the social and economic environment, the physical environment, and; the person’s individual characteristics and behaviours. The context of people’s lives determine their health, and so blaming individuals for having poor health or crediting them for good health is inappropriate. Individuals are unlikely to be able to directly control many of the determinants of health. These determinants—or things that make people healthy or not—include the above factors, and many others: Income and social status - higher income and social status are linked to better health. 1  The greater the gap between the richest and poorest people, the greater the differences in health. 2  Education – low education levels are linked with poor health, more stress and lower self-confidence.

7385221	The scales of most spruce cones are papery thin--yet another difference. And spruce bark is scaly--Douglas-fir and the true firs have smooth or ridged bark. There are approximately 40 different species of spruce in the world, but only 3 are native to the Pacific Northwest--and only 2 of those are common. Location is probably the best clue to their identity. : grows only along the Pacific coast, from northern California through southeastern Alaska, and only near sea level.
7385222	Generally, they do, but look closer. Feel the needles. Spruces have stiff, prickly needles, while Douglas-firs and true firs have soft, flexible needles. Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg; in fact, this peg is one of the best ways to identify a spruce.
7398706	Human genes are made of small parts, called exons, which are separated by long non-coding DNA sequences, called introns. When a gene is transcribed, the intervening introns are cut or “spliced” out, and the exons are strung back together to form the sequence that is then translated into protein.

You might think that large trees would have wide vessels and tracheids, so that water filters fast through the tree, but actually its the opposite. Trees have narrow vessels and tracheids so that water filters slowly up the tree. This indeed is less efficient at carrying water, but wider vessels are more likely to cavitate. In a woody plant, the trunk is almost entirely composed of vessels and tracheids. Tracheids differ from vessels in being much narrower

8052617	Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.
8052619	Contour Plowing & Terraces The Soil Erosion Service was one of the federal programs started in the 1930s to save the land that had been destroyed by years of wind erosion, over plowing, and over grazing. The commission taught farmers how to use terracing and contour plowing techniques to preserve the soil.
8052620	2016-09-28T08:13:26-04:00. Farmers can reduce soil erosion by contour plowing. The correct option among all the options that are given in the question is the second option or option B. The other choices given in the question are incorrect and can be neglected. I hope that this is the answer that has actually come to your desired help.
8052621	Contour plowing was a method of plowing furrows that follow the curves of the land rather than straight up and down slopes. Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.
8052622	Farmers can reduce soil erosion by___. A. increasing irrigation.. . B. contour plowing.. . C. grazing cattle on the land.. . D. plowing up roots. - 1851268
8052623	Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion.
8052624	In contour plowing, the land is plowed across the slopes and along the contour lines. This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.

8252759	According to the 2007 book Legionella and the prevention of legionellosis from the World Health Organization, temperature affects the survival of Legionella as follows: 1  Above 70 °C (158 °F) – Legionella dies almost instantly. 2  At 60 °C (140 °F) – 90% die in 2 minutes (Decimal reduction time (D) = 2 minutes)
8252761	It was shown as early as 1979 that a specific soluble antigen was present in the urine of patients with Legionnaires disease.(1) The presence of Legionella antigen in urine makes this an ideal specimen for collection, transport, and subsequent detection in early, as well as later, stages of the disease.
8252762	-Other serogroups (other than serogroup 1, which is detected by this assay) and other Legionella species (other than Legionella pneumophila) can cause disease. -Antigen may not be present in urine in early infection. -The level of antigen may be below the detection limit of the test.
8252763	Repeat testing may be required. If a Legionella pneumophila urine antigen test is positive, then it is likely that a person has a Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 infection. If the person has symptoms consistent with pneumonia, then it is likely that the person has Legionnaires disease.
8252764	Legionella pneumophila antigen—this is the preferred initial test for Legionnaires disease. It detects one of the bacterium's proteins. It is performed on urine and occasionally on another body fluid. It is a rapid way to detect an infection, but it will only detect Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1.

8255703	Best Times to Visit Jamaica. The best time to visit Jamaica is November to mid-December. That's when the island's already beautiful weather (ranging from mid-70s to the high 80s all year-round) is the most pleasant and the hotel and flight deals are the easiest to find. Rates are also cheap during the summer, but you'll risk the wrath of hurricane season.
8255704	(Mandeville and Treasure Beach are located in this region.) The eastern coast of Jamaica is the windward coast and receives the most rain on the island. (This is where Port Antonio is located.) Generally, the weather in Jamaica is characterized by a cool, caressing sea breeze by day and a gentle breeze from the mountains by night.
8255705	Jamaica Weather: Month-by-Month. Here's a month-by-month idea of weather in Jamaica. The weather is perfect most of the year. This month-by-month Jamaica weather forecast will help you in deciding when is the best time to visit Jamaica. December Weather in Jamaica: It's high season, and a cool time of year. January Weather: Middle of the high season.
8255706	And it's absolutely true. This is Jamaica weather! Most of our days are filled with warmth and sunshine, even during the rainy season. Jamaica has a tropical climate with hot and humid weather at sea level. The higher inland regions have a more temperate climate. (Bring a light jacket just in case you travel to the mountains where temperatures can be 10 degrees cooler or in case you go on a windy boat ride).
8260787	Moreover, RNAs are made in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, but function in protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. Unlike prokaryotic mRNAs, eukaryotic mRNAs undergo extensive modifications after synthesis by RNA polymerase II.he intervening sequences that are removed are called introns. The process by which introns are removed is referred to as splicing. The sequences remaining after the splicing are called exons. All of the different major types of RNA in a eukaryotic cell can have introns.
8266017	1. Get a large enough tank. The minimal tank size for one goldfish is 10-15 US gallons (56.7 liters)(Remember, they grow to about 10-12 inches (25.5-30.5 centimeters), and sometimes over!) and you will need to add 10 U.S. gallons (37.8 liters) onto that for each additional goldfish.
8272972	But much of the responsibility of the social inequity that leads to different health outcomes lies elsewhere. Health is affected by policies in other sectors, such as education, taxation, transport, and agriculture too.
8273011	The best way to get goldfish to grow the fastest is you give them as much room as you can then you give them growth food from the store. You can find it at almost any store that sells fish food. This will ensure that it will grow fast and big. blackheart_21 · 7 years ago.
8273013	A mother claims she has to keep buying new tanks for her foot-long goldfish who is still growing - and gets 'angry and violent' if he is not fed on time. When Anne Cooper, 56, bought two goldfish from a Scarborough pet store three years ago, they were both only an inch long.
8273015	A good filter, with no heater, is recommended because these fish can get larger than 12 inches (300 mm). Tank recommendations range up to 75 US gallons (280 l; 62 imp gal). It is possible to keep small goldfish in smaller tanks, but such an arrangement will be very difficult to maintain once the fish grows older.
8273017	pond goldfish like comets, shubunkins, and wakins can grow well over 12inches. fancier varieties like ranchus,lionhead,and orandas can grow over 10 inches. other fancy varieties like ryukins,black moors, fantails, etc. can grow over 6-7 inches. The largest goldfish recorded is over 16 inches.
8273019	The bigger the fishtank, the bigger the fish will grow.Not only does it matter how big your tank/pond is but it also depends greatly on what the fish is fed, the variety of the fish, and the fishes genetics. Many goldfish can grow over a foot long- here is a list of standard sizes to expect a goldfish to grow:
8273754	Sharks' blood gives them turbo speed. Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.
8273755	Are sharks cold-blooded or warm-blooded? Sharks have a reputation as “cold-blooded killers” and despite how negative that term is, it’s not entirely inaccurate. Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.
8273756	A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. There are currently two species of mako recognized, the Longfin (Isurus paucus) and the Shortfin (I. oxyrinchus).
8273757	For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.
8273758	More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.
8273760	But the advantages of endothermy are costly. To maintain a warm body in cold water, a mackerel shark must burn fuel like a blast furnace. A warm-bodied shark may need more than ten times as much food as a cold-bodied shark of the same size.
8273761	These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.
8273762	Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting.
8273763	Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.
8281322	CPAP is a treatment that uses mild air pressure to keep your breathing airways open. Overview It involves using a CPAP machine that includes a mask or other device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth, straps to position the mask, a tube that connects the mask to the machine’s motor, and a motor that blows air into the tube.
8283528	Earning your RN with a diploma program usually is a one or two year process. Getting your BSN straight out of high school will take four years. The advantage to earning your RN with a diploma program is that it does not take as much time as a BSN. Once you pass your NCLEX exam, you can then start to work as a nurse.
8283530	These stats show that an RN is eligible for 51% of these jobs, while a BSN holder is going to be eligible for 88% of the jobs. Also, the analysis in this study of salary showed that the mean salary for associate’s or RN holders was $66,000, and for those with a BSN, it was $75,000.
8283531	Short version: All BSNs are RNs, but not all RNs are BSNs. RN is registered nurse. You can get there via a diploma program, an associates degree (ADN) program or a bachelors degree (BSN) program. A BSN RN is just an RN with a bachelor's degree--basically, they have the most schooling and it (usually) takes the longest to achieve.
8283532	Difference Between Rn and Bsn. RN vs BSN. RN is a Registered Nurse, and is a health care specialist who uses her learned nursing practices and processes to take care of an ailing person. A Registered Nurse is trained and qualified to treat patients. The Associate degree is two years, but on the other hand, the Bachelors degree takes four years.
8289253	It is important for anyone with PTSD to be treated by a mental health care professional who is experienced with PTSD. Some people will need to try different treatments to find what works for their symptoms. Exposure therapy.
8293805	Commonwealth of Independent States; putative successor to the USSR, except that the Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania never joined. Contrary to another definition of CIS at the Urban Dictionary, the CIS does not stand for Communist Independent States..
8294083	The San Andreas Fault in California is one example. 2. Divergent boundaries occur where two plates slide apart from each other. Mid-ocean ridges (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and active zones of rifting (such as Africa's Great Rift Valley) are both examples of divergent boundaries.. Convergent boundaries (or active margins) occur where two plates slide towards each other commonly forming either a subduction zone (if one plate moves underneath the other) or a continental collision (if the two plates contain continental crust). Deep marine trenches are typically associated with subduction zones.
8295161	The ventilator delivers preset breaths in coordination with the respiratory effort of the patient. With each inspiratory effort, the ventilator delivers a full assisted tidal volume. Spontaneous breathing independent of the ventilator between A/C breaths is not allowed.
8299659	In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).
8299661	Two facts about these functions are: 1  if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero. 2  In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see Cantor function.
8299665	Two facts about these functions are: 1  if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero. 2  if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is Riemann integrable.
8299668	page 1 of 3. First, let's establish some definitions: f is said to be increasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. f is said to be decreasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval. This knowledge will later allow us to sketch rough graphs of functions. Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is increasing on [a, b] . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is decreasing on [a, b] . This should make intuitive sense. In the graph below, wherever the slope of the tangent is positive, the function seems to be increasing.

8319214	The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, site of the first known outbreak of Legionnaires' disease. The hotel closed in November, 1976, four months after the outbreak. The 1976 Legionnaires Disease outbreak also known as Legion Fever, refers to the first known cases of infection by Legionella pneumophila in the United States.
8319215	However, the number of infections is probably higher because many infections aren’t diagnosed or reported. Some cases are so mild that affected individuals never seek treatment. The symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease are similar to those of other types pneumonia. These symptoms may include fever, chills, and a cough. Many people who are exposed to Legionella don’t become sick. When illness does occur, however, it’s important to see a doctor right away.
8319216	An outbreak of this disease in Philadelphia in 1976, largely among people attending a state convention of the American Legion, led to the name Legionnaires' Disease.. Subsequently, the bacterium causing the illness was named Legionella pneumophila and the name of the illness was changed to legionellosis.

8327407	An Axon Terminal is the very end of a branch of a nerve's axon, a long slender nerve fiber that conducts electrical signals to a nerve synapse (the gap between nerve cells).
8327408	Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that are released from the axon and received by effector cells. This process is critical for delivery of the message to the cells and tissues that are being controlled. The terminal, then, is the final point of stimulation in the axon before the charge is delivered.
8332127	Here's what else you should know about dealing with a flea outbreak: 1  The fleas you see on your pet(s) are just the tip of the iceberg. 2  Fleas hatch in intervals as often as every two weeks. 3  Fleas lay their eggs on hosts (dogs and cats). 4  Pet-free households can also become infested by fleas.
8332546	By Mayo Clinic Staff. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.
8332547	Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1  High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.  Aortic valve stenosis.
8332551	Ventricular hypertrophy is the thickening of the ventricular walls (lower chambers) in the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy is more common, enlargement can also occur in the right ventricle, or both ventricles. 1 Physiology.
8332555	What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.
8333912	Of the deaths, 83 were suicides -- just less than 13%. Mental health in the military: Share your story. Those who had committed suicide generally had been deployed for fewer days in a row than other study participants; being deployed for longer than a year was actually associated with a lower risk of suicide.
8333916	When researchers asked 72 soldiers at Fort Carson, Colo., why they tried to kill themselves, out of the 33 reasons they had to choose from, all of the soldiers included one in particular — a desire to end intense emotional distress.

8383461	Mechanical ventilation is the use of a mechanical device (machine) to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.
8383462	Mechanical ventilation systems come in a variety of forms. Almost all systems use a machine called a ventilator that pushes air through a tube for delivery to the patient's airways. The air may be delivered through a nasal or face mask, or through an opening in the trachea (windpipe), called a tracheostomy.
8383463	A basic distinction in mechanical ventilation is whether each breath is initiated by the patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.

The continental margin is the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from thick continental crust.Together, the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise are called continental margin. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.
8714085	The transition from continental to oceanic crust commonly occurs within the outer part of the margin, called continental rise. Oceanwards beyond the edge of the rise lies the abyssal plain.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.
8714087	A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.he continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop-off that marks the beginning of the continental slope. That drop-off is known as the continental shelf break. Continental shelves vary in width from 3 to 930 miles (5 to 1,500 kilometers).

8731618	Humoral immunity may play a secondary role. Once infection is established, Legionella organisms cause an acute fibrinopurulent pneumonia with alveolitis and bronchiolitis. In addition to the lungs, Legionella organisms may infect the lymph nodes, brain, kidney, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and myocardium. Previous.
8731620	More specifically, this genus includes the species Legionella pneumophila, which are non-encapsulated, aerobic bacilli. In addition to L. pneumophila, there are 41 other species in the genus and together these species divide into 64 serogroups.
8731621	Legionnaires disease (LD) is the pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. LD also refers to a more benign, self-limited, acute febrile illness known as Pontiac fever, which has been linked serologically to L pneumophila, although it presents without pneumonia. (See Pathophysiology and Etiology.)
8731622	Within the species L. pneumophila, human infection is caused primarily (but not exclusively) by a limited number of serogroups—serogroups 1, 4, and 6. L. pneumophila is the most frequent cause of human legionellosis, better known as Legionnaire’s disease in the Legionellaceae family. It is also a relatively common cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia in adults. (1) And L. pneumophila serogroup 1 alone is responsible for 70-90% of cases.
8731623	Although several other species of the genus Legionella were subsequently identified, L pneumophila is the most frequent cause of human legionellosis and a relatively common cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia in adults.
8731624	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Legionella pneumophila is a thin, aerobic, pleomorphic, flagellated, nonspore-forming, Gram-negative bacterium of the genus Legionella. L. pneumophila is the primary human pathogenic bacterium in this group and is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, also known as legionellosis. 1 Characterization.
8731625	Legionnaires disease (LD) was recognized in 1976 after an outbreak of pneumonia at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Soon after, the etiologic agent was identified as a fastidious gram-negative bacillus and named Legionella pneumophila.
